 * Tournament Manager made by David Duh
 * 
 * This is the tournament manager I made for the project that you guys assigned
 * There are two screens, one to update and manage gamer entries and another one to
 * hold the tournament. It is a very basic tournament style with the players being placed
 * by going down the list. If this was a real tournament manager I could add a random number
 * generator to keep things interesting, but this program displays the data manipulating
 * methods to alter a database by adding, deleting, and updating data.
 * 
 * If I was to do this project again more officialy there are some things I would do differently
 * I would make the list re-compose the checkboxes every time one was deleted so it would be a
 * smooth list. I would also add a random number generator to make the tournaments different and
 * possibly make a dynamic number of people needed for a tournament(as long as it was an even number).
 * I would also have created a class for the check boxes, I did not realize I would need them twice
 * until I got to the next screen.
 * 
 * If you have any questions or want to see me implement anything else into the tournament manager, let
 * me know. Thank you, David Duh.
